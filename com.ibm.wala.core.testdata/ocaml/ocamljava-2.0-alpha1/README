OCaml-Java is an extension of the original OCaml implementation that
allows compilation of OCaml sources to Java bytecode. It is thus
possible to run compiled code on any Java Virtual Machine.

To install OCaml-Java, you only have to add the "bin" subdirectory of
the uncompressed archive to your path. Then, the following executables
are available:
  - compilers: ocamlc, and ocamljava;
  - tools: ocaml, ocamlbuild, ocamldebug, ocamldep, ocamldoc, ocamlj,
    ocamljar, ocamllex, ocamlrun, and ocamltop;
  - camlp4 preprocessors: camlp4o, camlp4of, camlp4oof, camlp4orf,
    camlp4r, and camlp4rf.

The "ocamljava" compiler behaves like the "ocamlc" and "ocamlopt" ones,
except that file extensions differ:
  - .cmo/.cmx files are replaced by .cmj files;
  - .cma/.cmxa files are replaced by .cmja files;
  - .o files are replaced by .jo files;
  - generated executable files have the .jar extension, if not specified
    the executable name is "camlprog.jar".

Bugs reports and/or feedback can be sent via two channels:
  - by mail to "ocamljava@x9c.fr";
  - by web pages through "http://bugs.x9c.fr".
